<h1>Basketball Score Board Project.</h1>
<p>This project was built from scracth by me alone.<br><br>
It shows a score board of both the home and guest team in a basketball game, number of fouls commited by both teams, and a new game button that resets everything back to zero for the commencement of a fresh game.<br><br>
I used HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT to develop this page.</p>
<ul>
  <li>I implemented flex box </li>
  <li>I used function in all the buttons to add scores, fouls and restart game.</li>
  <li>I called innertext to dispay the result in each field</li>
</ul>


## Supporting Scrimba

Since 2017, we have created over 20 free courses on Scrimba, and we're going to
continue launching free courses. But to pay our bills, we have to charge once
in a while. So if you've ever wanted to "give back" to Scrimba, you can do that by buying
	one of our paid courses

- [Become a professional React developer](https://scrimba.com/course/greact)
- [The Responsive Web Design Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gresponsive)
- [The Ultimate JavaScript Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gjavascript)

	It would also mean the world to us if you share the courses.  

Happy Coding!
